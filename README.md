## What is LibreFind?

LibreFind is an Android app that scans your device, identifies proprietary software, and recommends Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) alternatives. It uses **semantic web federation** (Wikidata + Firebase) instead of maintaining a centralized proprietary database.

### Core Mission
Help users replace proprietary apps with FOSS alternatives.
